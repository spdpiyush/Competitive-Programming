Problem Set:

	1. Nearest Greater Element to Left.
	2. Nearest Greater Element to Right. ( Next Largest Element) -> Important 
	3. Nearest Smaller to Left.
	4. Nearest Smaller to Right.


	So, Basically all of these are Problems are similar with minor Variations.
	
	1. Nearest Greater Element to Left : Here we have to find the next Immediate Greater element to the Left Side.
	
	Ex : N = 8, arr[] = {10, 3, 0, 1, 15, 0, 2, 4}
	
			o/p : {-1, 10, 3, 3, -1, 15, 15, 15 }

	 Approach 1 --> This can be solved in O(n^2) time complexity by running 2 for Loop, where for each element we will run the loop to sear                        ch the nearest greater element on the left side.

		// Code
		public static int[] nextGreaterToLeft(int[] arr, int size) {
        	int[] ngl = new int[size];
        	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            	int max = -1;
            	for (int j = i-1; j >= 0; j--) {
                	if (arr[j] > arr[i]) {
                    	max = arr[j];
                    	break;
                	}
            	}
           		ngl[i] = max;
        	}
        	return ngl;
    	}

    	Time Complexity : O(N ^ 2)
    	Space Complexity : O(N)
		
	 Approach 2 --> By using Stack
			i. if stack is empty , -1
			ii. keep poping the elements which are smaller than the current element.
			iii. print top element of stack if stack not empty else print -1. 

		//Code 

		public int[] nextGreaterToLeft(int[] arr, int size) {
			int[] ngl = new int[size];
			Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
			for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
				if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
					while(!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() <= arr[i]) {
						stack.pop();
					}
				}
				ngl[i] = stack.isEmpty() ? -1 : stack.peek();
				stack.push(arr[i]);
			}
			return ngl;
		}

		Time Complexity : o(N)
	
	2. Nearest Greater Element to Right
	
	Approach 1 --> Applying the Brute Force.

	Time Complexity --> O( N ^ 2)
